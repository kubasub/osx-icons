# OSX Icons #

Open source icons that complement OSX pre-Yosemite.

## Installing Icons ##

1. Download the icon that you want (`<ICON_NAME>.icns`)
2. Put the icon in `/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/`.
    Note: You need to right-click on `CoreTypes.bundle` and select "Show Package Contents".

## Notes ##

- OSX has lost much of it's skeuomorphic-look as of Yosemite. This is why these icons complement OSX < 10.10.
